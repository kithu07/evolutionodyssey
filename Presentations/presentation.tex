\begin{column}{0.7\textwidth}
    The game is an evolution-themed 2D platformer built using
     Lua and LÖVE2D. It starts with a monkey in a forest
    collecting bananas while avoiding obstacles.
    As the player progresses, the environment changes to a
    street, and the character evolves into a human 
    collecting money. The goal is to collect as many 
    items as possible while avoiding obstacles, with the
    player's score tracked and displayed at the end of 
    each game session. If the player achieves a new high
    score, it is updated and displayed.
